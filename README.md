# NeuralNetwork

## Assignment1 
1. Find the feasibility of changing the activation function and apply it to the network (with
required adjustments). Analyze the performance of the network with different (at least two)
activation function for classification of linearly separable data provided with tutorial. You are
free to choose the number of epochs and other hyperparameters for training.
2. Use only first three features of every data point (dimensionality of data point=3) for
classification task and observe the classification accuracy for linearly separable data.
This part may be performed with only single activation function of your choice.


**Deliverables:**
- The colab notebook(s) downloaded in .ipynb format
- Screenshot of the training loss and testing accuracy as .png/.tiff files.
