# NeuralNetwork

## Assignment1 
1. Find the feasibility of changing the activation function and apply it to the network (with
required adjustments). Analyze the performance of the network with different (at least two)
activation function for classification of linearly separable data provided with tutorial. You are
free to choose the number of epochs and other hyperparameters for training.
2. Use only first three features of every data point (dimensionality of data point=3) for
classification task and observe the classification accuracy for linearly separable data.
This part may be performed with only single activation function of your choice.


**Deliverables:**
- The colab notebook(s) downloaded in .ipynb format
- Screenshot of the training loss and testing accuracy as .png/.tiff files.

## Assignment2
Design a Convolutional Neural Network similar to what is shown in Tutorial 2. Use an extra layer
of convolution, relu, and maxpool and assess the performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets for 20 epochs. You are free to choose the learning rate and the optimiser type. Any
other parameter like kernel size, stride, etc is also entirely up to the choice of the experimenter.
CIFAR-10 dataset can be loaded similarly from PyTorchâ€™s available functions. Check PyTorch
docs for more details.
NO NEED TO USE BATCHNORM2D. Do the experiment without that layer.
